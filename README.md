# My personal Scoop Bucket

[![Tests](https://github.com/matijabozic/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/matijabozic/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/ci.yml) [![Excavator](https://github.com/matijabozic/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/matijabozic/scoop-bucket/actions/workflows/excavator.yml)

This is my personal bucket for [Scoop](https://scoop.sh), the Windows command-line installer. <br />
I will add manifests for apps here, that are not popular enough to be included in "known" buckets, but I find them useful and use them on daily basis.

How do I use this bucket?
---------------------------------
To add this bucket, run: <br />
`scoop bucket add scoop-bucket https://github.com/matijabozic/scoop-bucket`<br />

To install apps: <br />
`scoop install <manifest>`

You can change name `scoop-bucket` to any other name you want to use locally.<br />
It's only important to use correct github link.
